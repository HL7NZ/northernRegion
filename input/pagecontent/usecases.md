### Identify a Patient
As a Health Professional, I want to retrieve patient records in PAS using patient identifiers (at least 3) so that:

* I can correctly identify if the person in an existing or new patient of the DHB
* Can verify if the person I am interacting with is the same person on my record

### Know a Patient
As a Health Professional, I want to know the patient’s preferred language so that I may know how best to communicate with them.

### Check Patient’s Eligibility for Service
As a Health Professional, I want to know the patient’s citizenship so that I may confirm their eligibility to use DHB’s services

### Sending of Clinic Letters/ Documents, Discharge Summaries
As a clinician producing a discharge summary or clinic letter for my patient in I want to ensure that the discharge summary/ clinic letter is populated with the latest patient demographic details so that I have confidence in the accuracy of data as this is shared with the patient and their care team e.g. Primary Care, Specialists and that the correct GP/Referrer receives a copy.  


### Verify Patient vs. Healthcare GP, Practice
As a Health Professional, I want to compare patient-GP records in PAS versus MOH records so that I can keep the patient-GP information in PAS up to date.

### Patient Context in Clinical Portals
As a Health Professional, I want to know the patient’s preferred language so that I may know how best to communicate with them.
